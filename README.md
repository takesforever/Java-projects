## Object oriented Programming

- usually relies on the concept of classes and objects
- to make a code around an object (not function or logic)
- makes it easier to develop complex, large and/or actively maintained programs
- major concepts : inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism


## JVM
- Java Virtual Machine
- allows java program to run in any device - write once, run anywhere
- manages and optimize program memory
- works like an interpreter


## DI
- Dependency Injection
- implementation of IoC
- 용도에 따라 필요한 객체를 생성

## IoC
- Inversion of Control
- allows classes to be loosely coupled -> easier to make changes or test
- framework takes control of the flow of a program


## Bean
- 스프링이 관리하는 객체
